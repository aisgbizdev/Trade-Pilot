// Cost/revenue/profit accounting segmentation (product decision — see
// chat). Three MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE buckets, in this priority order:
//   1. "dev" — admin has ever set a per-user quota override
//      (customQuotaPerDay IS NOT NULL). Treated as an internal/testing
//      account, not real business activity, even if it also has a real
//      top-up on record (e.g. an admin testing the payment flow).
//   2. "paid" — not dev, and has at least one "topup_approval"
//      credit_ledger entry ever (lifetime, regardless of current
//      balance — reusing the same ledger the credit-balance feature
//      already tracks, not a separate signal).
//   3. "free" — everyone else.
//
// Centralized here (rather than duplicated per route) so GET /admin/stats'
// totals, GET /superadmin/users' per-row segment + ?segment= filter, and
// GET /admin/analytics/tokens' bySegment breakdown can never drift apart.
