// Sign in with Apple (native app flow) for login / registration.
//
// The mobile app runs Apple's native authorization UI, obtaining an
// `identityToken` (a JWT signed by Apple) and an `authorizationCode`, then
// posts both — plus the RAW nonce it generated (Apple only ever sees the
// SHA-256 hash of it) — to POST /auth/apple/native. The server:
//   1. verifies the identity token's signature against Apple's published
//      JWKS (never just decodes it), issuer, audience, expiry, and nonce;
//   2. exchanges the authorization code with Apple's own token endpoint as
//      a second, independent proof that the code is genuine, unexpired,
//      and unused;
//   3. upserts the account (match apple_id -> link by verified email ->
//      create) and issues a normal TradePilot session.
//
// Config (env):
//   APPLE_TEAM_ID              - Apple Developer Team ID
//   APPLE_KEY_ID               - Key ID of the Sign in with Apple `.p8` key
//   APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY          - PKCS#8 private key from the `.p8` file.
//                                Read only from env/deployment secrets —
//                                never checked into source. `\n` is
//                                unescaped the same way the Firebase
//                                service-account key is handled elsewhere
//                                in this codebase, so the value can be
//                                stored as a single-line secret.
//   APPLE_ALLOWED_CLIENT_IDS   - comma-separated allowlist of audiences
//                                (bundle ids / services ids) accepted as
//                                the `aud` of a native identity token.
//   APPLE_NATIVE_CLIENT_ID     - optional override for the client_id used
//                                when exchanging an authorization code.
//                                Defaults to whichever allowed audience the
//                                identity token actually matched — correct
//                                for a single native iOS app.
//
// Never logged, anywhere in this module or its callers: identityToken,
// authorizationCode, nonce, the generated client-secret JWT, or any Apple
// token-endpoint response body.
